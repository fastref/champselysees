#  rubyment

A ruby class having many functions.

Each of the functions are callable from the command line.

E.g: the `main` function just outputs the arguments given
to `rubyment.rb`, like this:

````
./rubyment.rb main arg1 arg2 arg3
main arg1 arg2 arg3
````

For functions that won't get strings as
parameter, it may be difficult to give the arguments
from the command line. Functions starting with `shell_`
are specially prepared to be called from the command
line.
