# bashement

Set of bashscript functions to do miscelaneous things.

The idea is that, instead or creating each file for every script I want to
create, I'll put each one in a function, that will be loaded by
`bashement.sh`.

All the functions in `bashement.sh` starts with `bm_`

## Some functions:

####  function bm_psql_restore_dump
dumps `bm_db_dump_file` into  `bm_db_name`
